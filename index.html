    <p>I am an Electrical Engineer currently working for <a href="https://cmlinternational.net/" target="_blank">CML International (Dubai) LLC</a> at the United Arab Emirates as Testing and Commissioning Engineer.
        I have accumulated 10 years of experience in various fields of Electrical Engineering including Manufacturing,
        Construction Project Management, MEP Testing and Commissioning and so on. But my interest is really in the Tech industry, coding in particular, and so I have decide to 
        start my journey to break into the Tech industry by learning <a href="https://www.udemy.com/" target="_blank">Web Development</a>...so follow along in my journey.</p>

    <h3><strong>Education and Work Background</strong></h3>
    <p>I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering at the Ramon Magsaysay Techonological University (Currently PRMSSU) in Iba, Zambales, Philippines in 2011.
        Upon obtaining my professional license, I started working as a Product Engineer at Nicera Philippines Inc, a japanese manufacturing firm which manufactures sensors for consumer electronics.
        I left the manufacturing industry after a few months to pursue a career in the constrution industry and there I work for a small company in Makati, Philippines as a Project Engineer mainly handling fitout electrical installation works.
        There I met people who instroduced me in the MEP Testing and Commissioning industry and later on would become my colleages at FORSSPAC International, an Engineering Consultancy firm headquartered at Makati City, Philippines.
